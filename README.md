​
- an app encorporating MYSQL to display content from the database - in this case, bikes (or other human powered pedal machines) - of all types - and to ride them or leave them be.
​
##Getting started
​
To test and use this app on your local machine, you will have to download this GIT project in its entirety. If not viewing on HEROKU, you will have to build your own database using the schema for MYSQL provided within the app. =
​
You will also have to install NPM Node modules to communicate with the API’s to access and display the data. 
​
Incorporate the ‘npm install’ command after you have first initialized NPM in your file - to then get the correct dependencies. 
​
Those NPM modules include:
​
request - to govern the request action 
MYSQL
BodyParser
Path
​
##Functionality
​
When all files are installed, at the command line, start the app in your terminal using either NODEMON or NODE followed by 'server.js', Then within your browser, you would have to type, in the command line:
​
localhost://3000
